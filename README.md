<b>Maintenance and Prevention System (MaPS)</b> is a system developed by the Airport Technology Section to manage and analyze airport technology maintenance data in a dynamic operational environment. This system supports efficient maintenance processes and the implementation of the <b>Smart Airport</b> concept through equipment monitoring, early problem detection, and responsive handling of technical issues.
